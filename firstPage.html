	<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the <strong>printing and typesetting industry.</strong> Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic <b>typesetting, remaining essentially</b> unchanged. 
		
	<p>It was popularised in the 1960s with the <em>release</em> of Letraset sheets containing <b><i>Lorem Ipsum</i></b> passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
